# lab1_a: Combinational Exercises and Debugging Sequential Machines

In the second week of class, we'll be releasing the main component of the lab (`lab1_b`). This pre-lab is meant to warm you up and give you some practice with Bluespec and reasoning about hardware. It is also meant to give you a chance to see points of confusion that we can clarify in office hours or recitation.

This pre-lab has two parts: combinational exercises, and a sequential debugging exercise. They each have their own handout. Please track how much time you spend on each part.

- In the first part, we ask you to implement several combinational circuits.
- In the second part, we provide you with a buggy module that implements a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) between two vectors. We have declared the state elements at the top of the module for you, but there are some bugs in the rules and methods. We ask you to identify and fix them.

Once you complete both parts of lab1_a, please submit on GitHub classroom. We also have a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelQ8Cr7wA8MFbJJOR6in3M7ua5R6NkmK6CfceSSwuFoNpdEw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for this assignment and other course content.

We're setting the due date for lab1_a to be the same as lab1_b, which we can call the lab1 due date (February 22nd before lecture). We will have checkoffs as soon as each part is out (see the Piazza for that) and for a few more days after the due date. You may checkoff each part separately or both together. Checkoffs will be required for the grade.

`make submit` in the main directory will upload your code and run the autograder :)

Although we're making them due the same day, please start early so we can help with any problems, and because we'll be releasing lab2 right after lab1 is due. ðŸ™‚
